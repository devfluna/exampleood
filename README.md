# Object-Oriented Design Example
## Description
This project is intended to be used as part of an Object-Oriented Design workshop.

## Disclaimer
This project incorporates an API sourced from Android's **Get data from the internet [codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-getting-data-internet#0)**. It is important to clarify that there is no intent to assert ownership over the utilized API. The decision to leverage it is rooted in the preference for utilizing an open and freely accessible API with simplicity as a key criterion. This choice aligns with the principles of respecting copyright laws and promoting the use of open and readily available resources.
